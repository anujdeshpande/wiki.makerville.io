[28pins](https://github.com/FEDEVEL/28pins) and  [iMX rex board](https://www.imx6rex.com/community/) by Robert Feranac, they have amazing documentation

nRF52 reference designs these are great as these design are used in production of their development kits.
- [nRF52 remote](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Reference-designs/nRFready-Smart-Remote-3-for-nRF52-Series) is a BT remote to build off of.
- [nRF52 desktop](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Reference-designs/nRF-Desktop) ( includes design files for keyboard, mouse and dongle)
- [nRF9160 development kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF9160-DK/Download#infotabs) for NB-IoT designs
- [Thingy 52](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Nordic-Thingy-52/Download?lang=en#infotabs) - On how to use battery management for these IoT projects.

[Olimex](https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/STMP1/open-source-hardware) - Great open source board designed with KiCAD.

[DeplthAI hardware](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware) - for vision related projects. most designs use intel ai module, you cannot replicate the designs but a good resource to learn about how CSI interconnects are laid out.

- [LimeSDR](https://limemicro.com/boards/limesdr/) - Great board to learn about RF
- [Ubertooth one](https://greatscottgadgets.com/ubertoothone/) - Bluetooth experiments

[Toradex Reference design board](https://developer.toradex.com/carrier-board-design/reference-designs/ )- This company sells SoMs Their reference design are good for high speed interconnects

Smart watches
- [Hexiwear](https://github.com/MikroElektronika/HEXIWEAR) - smart watch design, good for looking for techniques on how to make a compact design.
- [Watchy](https://github.com/sqfmi/Watchy) - Watch with E-paper display.

CM4 reference boards
- [Retro-Lite-CM4](https://github.com/StonedEdge/Retro-Lite-CM4) - Great project with a finished product.
- [QWAVE_Raspberry-Pi-CM4-Altium-Library](https://github.com/QWaveSystems/QWAVE_Raspberry-Pi-CM4-Altium-Library) for designing CM4 based carrier boards in Altium

Studying these design will for sure help you to become more better at design
